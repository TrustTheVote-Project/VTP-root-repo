# Future VoteTracker+ Goals, Directions, and Notes

This directory is a capturing long-term VoteTracker+ ideas, documentation, and notes.  By long-term it is meant beyond First Customer Ship (FCS) into multiple public elections.

FCS is basically a ballot tracking system for paper ballots.  As of 2022/04/25, the thought is that long-term VoteTracker+ would be a more thorough and complete handling of the pre, day-of, and post election day workflows.  The original idea behind VoteTracker+ is to  dramatically increase the trustworth-ness and security of a public election.

### VoteTracker+ 1.0 (a.k.a. FCS) concerns the tracking of paper ballots and their related [Cast Vote Records](https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionGlossary/#cast-vote-record).

### VoteTracker+ 2.0 includes the dramatic reduction of the cost and time of setting up, testing, securing, running, auditing, adjudicating, and certifying a public election by more directly supplying more of the back-office infrastructure required to hold a public election.
